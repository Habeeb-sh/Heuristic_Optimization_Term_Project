Overview
The 0/1 Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem where you must select a subset of items with given weights and values to maximize total value while staying within a weight constraint. This implementation uses a Genetic Algorithm with several optimization techniques to find high-quality solutions efficiently.
Features
Core Algorithm Features
‚Ä¢	Hybrid Initialization: Combines random and greedy heuristic-based chromosome creation
‚Ä¢	Penalty-based Fitness: Handles constraint violations with adaptive penalty coefficients
‚Ä¢	Smart Repair Mechanism: Converts infeasible solutions to feasible ones
‚Ä¢	Elitism: Preserves best solutions across generations
‚Ä¢	Multiple Mutation Types: Bit-flip and swap mutations for diversity
‚Ä¢	Tournament Selection: Efficient parent selection mechanism
‚Ä¢	Early Stopping: Prevents unnecessary computation when convergence is detected
Implementation Features
‚Ä¢	Optimized Performance: List comprehensions and efficient data structures
‚Ä¢	Comprehensive Logging: Detailed progress tracking and statistics
‚Ä¢	Flexible Input/Output: Supports various file formats and result export
‚Ä¢	Sample Data Generation: Built-in test data when input files are unavailable
‚Ä¢	Professional Documentation: Well-documented code with type hints
Installation
Prerequisites
‚Ä¢	Python 3.7 or higher
‚Ä¢	NumPy (for Jupyter notebook)

‚Ä¢	Jupyter Notebook (for interactive version)
Setup
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Habeeb-sh/Heuristic_Optimization_Term_Project.git
cd HProject

pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
Usage
Standalone Python Script (Option 1 ) 
from knapsack_ga import KnapsackGA

# Initialize the genetic algorithm
ga = KnapsackGA(
    population_size=200,
    mutation_rate=0.02,
    crossover_rate=0.8,
    max_generations=1000
)

# Load problem from file
ga.load_input("ks_40_0")

# Solve the problem
best_solution, best_value, stats = ga.solve()

# Display results
ga.print_solution(best_solution, best_value)
Jupyter Notebook ( Option 2) 
Launch the interactive notebook for experimentation:

 Algorithm Details
Genetic Algorithm Components
1.	Initialization
‚Ä¢	30% smart initialization using greedy heuristic
‚Ä¢	70% random initialization with weight-based bias
‚Ä¢	Automatic repair of 25% of initial population
2.	Selection
‚Ä¢	Tournament selection with configurable tournament size
‚Ä¢	Elitism preserving top 10% of solutions
3.	Crossover
‚Ä¢	Two-point crossover with 80% probability
‚Ä¢	Maintains genetic diversity while preserving building blocks
4.	Mutation
‚Ä¢	Bit-flip mutation with adaptive rates
‚Ä¢	Occasional swap mutation for structural changes
‚Ä¢	20% probability of repair after mutation
5.	Fitness Function
6.	fitness = value - Œ± √ó max(0, weight - capacity)
Where Œ± is the adaptive penalty coefficient
Optimization Techniques
‚Ä¢	Adaptive Penalty: Penalty coefficient scales with problem characteristics
‚Ä¢	Smart Repair: Removes items with worst value-to-weight ratios first
‚Ä¢	Early Stopping: Terminates when no improvement for 100 generations
‚Ä¢	Efficient Data Structures: Optimized for memory and speed

Results File
Detailed results are automatically saved to {filename}Results.txt with:
‚Ä¢	Solution vector and selected items
‚Ä¢	Weight utilization and constraint satisfaction
‚Ä¢	Performance statistics and convergence history
‚Ä¢	Detailed item analysis
Parameters
Parameter	Default	Description
population_size	200	Number of chromosomes per generation
mutation_rate	0.02	Probability of bit mutation
crossover_rate	0.8	Probability of crossover
max_generations	1000	Maximum number of generations
alpha	Auto	Penalty coefficient (auto-calculated if None)
Parameter Tuning Guidelines
‚Ä¢	Small problems (< 50 items): Use smaller population (50-100)
‚Ä¢	Large problems (> 200 items): Increase population (300-500)
‚Ä¢	High constraint satisfaction needed: Increase alpha penalty
‚Ä¢	Exploration vs Exploitation: Adjust mutation rate (0.01-0.05)
