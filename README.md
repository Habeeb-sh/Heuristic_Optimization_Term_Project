Overview
The 0/1 Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem where you must select a subset of items with given weights and values to maximize total value while staying within a weight constraint. This implementation uses a Genetic Algorithm with several optimization techniques to find high-quality solutions efficiently.
Features
Core Algorithm Features
•	Hybrid Initialization: Combines random and greedy heuristic-based chromosome creation
•	Penalty-based Fitness: Handles constraint violations with adaptive penalty coefficients
•	Smart Repair Mechanism: Converts infeasible solutions to feasible ones
•	Elitism: Preserves best solutions across generations
•	Multiple Mutation Types: Bit-flip and swap mutations for diversity
•	Tournament Selection: Efficient parent selection mechanism
•	Early Stopping: Prevents unnecessary computation when convergence is detected
Implementation Features
•	Optimized Performance: List comprehensions and efficient data structures
•	Comprehensive Logging: Detailed progress tracking and statistics
•	Flexible Input/Output: Supports various file formats and result export
•	Sample Data Generation: Built-in test data when input files are unavailable
•	Professional Documentation: Well-documented code with type hints
Installation
Prerequisites
•	Python 3.7 or higher
•	NumPy (for Jupyter notebook)
•	Matplotlib (for visualization in notebook)
•	Jupyter Notebook (for interactive version)
Setup
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Habeeb-sh/Heuristic_Optimization_Term_Project.git
cd HProject

pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
Usage
Standalone Python Script (Option 1 ) 
from knapsack_ga import KnapsackGA

# Initialize the genetic algorithm
ga = KnapsackGA(
    population_size=200,
    mutation_rate=0.02,
    crossover_rate=0.8,
    max_generations=1000
)

# Load problem from file
ga.load_input("ks_40_0")

# Solve the problem
best_solution, best_value, stats = ga.solve()

# Display results
ga.print_solution(best_solution, best_value)
Jupyter Notebook ( Option 2) 
Launch the interactive notebook for experimentation:

 Algorithm Details
Genetic Algorithm Components
1.	Initialization
•	30% smart initialization using greedy heuristic
•	70% random initialization with weight-based bias
•	Automatic repair of 25% of initial population
2.	Selection
•	Tournament selection with configurable tournament size
•	Elitism preserving top 10% of solutions
3.	Crossover
•	Two-point crossover with 80% probability
•	Maintains genetic diversity while preserving building blocks
4.	Mutation
•	Bit-flip mutation with adaptive rates
•	Occasional swap mutation for structural changes
•	20% probability of repair after mutation
5.	Fitness Function
6.	fitness = value - α × max(0, weight - capacity)
Where α is the adaptive penalty coefficient
Optimization Techniques
•	Adaptive Penalty: Penalty coefficient scales with problem characteristics
•	Smart Repair: Removes items with worst value-to-weight ratios first
•	Early Stopping: Terminates when no improvement for 100 generations
•	Efficient Data Structures: Optimized for memory and speed

Input Format
Input files should follow this format:
n_items max_weight
value1 weight1
value2 weight2
...
valueN weightN
Example Input File (ks_40_0):
4 5
10 5
40 4
30 6
50 3


Output Format
Console Output

Generation  50: Best=   140.0, Avg=   125.7, Feasible=178/200
...

BEST SOLUTION FOUND:
Total Value: 140
Solution: 0 1 0 1
Total Weight: 7/10
Selected Items: [1, 3]
Weight utilization: 70.0%
Constraint satisfied: Yes
Results File
Detailed results are automatically saved to {filename}Results.txt with:
•	Solution vector and selected items
•	Weight utilization and constraint satisfaction
•	Performance statistics and convergence history
•	Detailed item analysis
Parameters
Parameter	Default	Description
population_size	200	Number of chromosomes per generation
mutation_rate	0.02	Probability of bit mutation
crossover_rate	0.8	Probability of crossover
max_generations	1000	Maximum number of generations
alpha	Auto	Penalty coefficient (auto-calculated if None)
Parameter Tuning Guidelines
•	Small problems (< 50 items): Use smaller population (50-100)
•	Large problems (> 200 items): Increase population (300-500)
•	High constraint satisfaction needed: Increase alpha penalty
•	Exploration vs Exploitation: Adjust mutation rate (0.01-0.05)

 Examples
Basic Usage
