What to do:
1) Store the values for the remaining test (ks_40_0 & ks_60_0) in a file named "results_'nameOfTestedFile'" (write the code to do that automatically)
2) Separate the code if you want
3) Write the documentation in this format:
   `
     - Problem formulation and mathematical definition
     - Algorithm design and implementation details
     - Experimental setup and parameter settings
     - Results and analysis
     - Discussion of challenges and solutions
     - Contributions of each group member
   `
 4) You can add 'Advanced features,' which has 20% of the grade
 5) Update the readme to add how to run (in the current format, just run the code normally)
